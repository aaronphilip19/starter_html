            <h2> Chase </h2>
            <img src = "images/Chase_pose.JPG" alt = "Golden Labrador with red collar and tongue hanging out" width = "400" >
            <p>
                Chase is a 4 year old Labrador who resides in Dubai. His favorite activities include going on morning walks with his parents and lazily lying on the cold tiling in the house watching TV. His morning routine includes lightly banging on the glass-paned door gesturing for his breakfast that he so looks forward to every day. His breakfast serves as the fuel he needs to frolic around whilst I play basketball in his play area.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                Chase is quite the socialite when it comes to human interaction. He loves meeting strangers and often looks forward to engaging with his family’s friends whenever they are about. Sometimes his sheer enthusiasm can work to his detriment amongst strangers who are fearful of dogs wherein such enthusiasm only serves to build up fear. However, his extroverted nature is nowhere to be seen around other dogs as he becomes more reclusive and wants to hang around his parents solely.

            <img src = "images/Nickels.png" alt = "A smalll,cute white dog posing for the camera" width = "400" >
            <p>
               Nickel was adopted from Ohio in 2010 and actually turns 13 years old this year. His favorite artist is Taylor Swift and thus, he had a Taylor Swift themed birthday party. He has lived in the states of Illinois and California. His favorite word to hear from his parents is "present" and he loves being around them when opening and receiving gifts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nickel is also accompanied by another dog in his life named Socks. Socks was introudced to Nickel in 2020 and they have been at each other's necks,playfully, since then. Socks is no stranger to intentionally destroying Nickel's toys. A downside for Nickel is that Socks is allergic to peanut butter and thus, Nickel is never able to enjoy what used to be his favourite treat.
            </p>

            <p>
               Cooper is an eight year old Collie and Lab mix. He was rescued from the Humane society as a puppy. He is a very friendly dog, loves going on long walks and runs but he does have the habit of stopping to sniff something every few steps.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whenever it’s movie night, Cooper always tries to join on the family couch otherwise he does feel sort of left out. He loves to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.
            </p>

            <p>
               Luna is a German Shepherd mix and we consider her to be huge fireball of energy. One of her hobbies is playing catch at the park, as it gives her the "zoomies".Oftentimes, destroying anything in her path she will take and hide all your socks, shoes, and clothes for her to chew on
            </p>

            <p>
                Some qualities of Luna is that she is a very jealous, protectice and loving dog. She really embraces her inner chihuahua and will bark at any stranger, car, or noise at night. In some essence, she would make the perfect guard dog however, we think Luna is more a dog that is "all bark and no bite"
            </p>

            <p>
                Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around and eat whatever snacks he can find in his vicinity. You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cooky is still a baby but does have the tendency of getting hyper at times. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.

                Chief is a 9 year old pomeranian who loves to sleep as much as he can. He naps anywhere, ranging from someone's bed to the grass outside. He tends to enjoy his outside walls
            </p>
            <p>
                He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much easier.
